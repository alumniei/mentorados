# Code of conduct

The main goal of [mentor.alumniei.pt](/) is to be inclusive to the whole
community of alumni and students from FEUP/LEIC degrees, with the most varied
and diverse backgrounds possible. Our commitment is to provide a friendly, safe
and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion.

This code of conduct outlines what behaviors we expect the community to follow,
as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

If you are a FEUP/LEIC alumni or student, we invite you to participate in this
platform to help us create a safe and positive space to share experiences,
knowledge and questions.

Students and mentors are expected to behave by the following precepts:

- Respect the availability and contributions of the platform mentors, who offer
  their support pro bono.
- Respect students time by keeping your profile up to date and letting us know
  when you are not available to mentor students.
- Cultivate a network of support and encouragement for each other.
- Respect confidentiality over the elements and information shared in this
  platform.
- Respect the community. Do not proliferate demeaning, discriminatory, or
  harassing behavior and speech.
- Report members that conduct against our code of conduct.

Some examples of behaviors that will not be tolerated:

- Proliferate sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise
  discriminatory jokes and language.
- Post and/or display sexually explicit, violent, or inappropriate material.
- Disrespect in any way a member of the community.

If a mentor or student engages in harassing behavior, the staff may take any
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or banning them
from the platform.
