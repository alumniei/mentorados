<p>
  MIEIC students facing difficult career decisions, personal or academic
  problems at university or any other issues, can benefit from speaking to
  someone who has walked a similar path before.
</p>

<p>
  This platform was built to connect current MIEIC students looking for
  advice/mentorship, with MIEIC alumni who volunteer their time to lend a
  sympathetic ear and advise wherever they can.
</p>

  summary of their experiences and areas of expertise.
