# Mentorados

MIEIC students facing difficult career decisions, personal or academic problems
at university or any other issues, can benefit from speaking to someone who has
walked a similar path before.

This platform was built to connect current MIEIC students looking for
advice/mentorship, with MIEIC alumni who volunteer their time to lend a
sympathetic ear and advise wherever they can.
